description:
  The Sony IMX519 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor
  with an active array size of 4656H x 3496V. It is programmable through
  I2C interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1A as per sensor data sheet.
  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as either 2 or
  4 data lanes.
